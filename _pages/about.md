I’m Xiaohan Wu, a PhD candidate in Political Science with a specialization in Computational Social Science at the University of California, San Diego. Before joining UCSD, I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on data analysis from Columbia University and worked as a Data Science Research Associate at Columbia Law School.

My research interests are at the intersection of quantitative methods and political communication. I have worked on projects involving the analysis of large-scale legal text datasets, as well as the exploration of the political and legal implications of social media recommendation systems.


   
Outside of Research

When I’m not working on my research, you’ll find me dog training, cooking and hiking.
