I’m Xiaohan Wu, a PhD candidate in Political Science with a specialization in Computational Social Science at the University of California, San Diego. Before joining UCSD, I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a focus on data analysis from Columbia University and worked as a Data Science Research Associate at Columbia Law School.

My research interests are at the intersection of quantitative methods and political communication. I have worked on projects involving the analysis of large-scale legal text datasets, as well as the exploration of the political and legal implications of social media recommendation systems.
